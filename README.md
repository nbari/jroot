# jroot
command line tool to create and update jails aiming to simplify the life cycle management

# Why

Because maintaining multiple jails especially when they are not sharing a common
base adds extra complexity apart from being an operation that takes extra time
and effort and not easy to automate.

# The Goal

Simplify the life cycle of the jails:

* Keep up to date the shared base jail
* Simplify the update process
* Save resources by sharing a jail root `jroot` skeleton
